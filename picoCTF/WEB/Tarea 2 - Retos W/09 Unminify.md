#### Description

I don't like scrolling down to read the code of my website, so I've squished it. As a bonus, my pages load faster!

Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.


#### Hints
1. Try CTRL+U / ⌘+U in your browser to view the page source. You can also add 'view-source:' before the URL, or try `curl <URL>` in your shell.
2. Minification reduces the size of code, but does not change its functionality.
3. What tools do developers use when working on a website? Many text editors and browsers include formatting.


#### Solucion
1. Entramos a la url
2. Ctrl u, revisamos el codigo y encontramos la bandera.
