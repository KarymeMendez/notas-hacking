Can you find the flag inÂ [file](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/495d43ee4a2b9f345a4307d053b4d88d/file)? This would be really tedious to look through manually, something tells me there is a better way

## Solucion

```
cat file | grep "pico"
picoCTF{grep_is_good_to_find_things_5af9d829}
